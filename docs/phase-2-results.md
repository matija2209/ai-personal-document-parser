# Phase 2 Results - Database Schema & Setup

## ✅ Status: COMPLETED

Phase 2 has been successfully completed! All database schema design, setup, and testing tasks have been finished.

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Clerk.io Database Integration Research
- ✅ Researched Clerk's user data structure and metadata system
- ✅ Understood publicMetadata vs privateMetadata differences
- ✅ Identified best practices for user data synchronization
- ✅ Confirmed using Clerk user ID as foreign key reference
- ✅ Decided on local vs Clerk data storage strategy

### ✅ 2. Prisma Installation & Configuration
- ✅ Installed Prisma dependencies (`prisma`, `@prisma/client`)
- ✅ Initialized Prisma with `npx prisma init`
- ✅ Configured PostgreSQL provider for Neon database
- ✅ Set up environment variable configuration
- ✅ Created Prisma client singleton in `src/lib/prisma.ts`

### ✅ 3. Complete Database Schema Design
- ✅ Created comprehensive Prisma schema with 5 main models:
  - **User**: Stores Clerk user sync data with preferences
  - **Document**: Main document records with retention logic
  - **DocumentFile**: File storage metadata and references
  - **Extraction**: AI extraction results with confidence scores
  - **ProcessingError**: Error tracking with retry logic
- ✅ Added proper indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Configured foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- ✅ Implemented soft delete pattern for documents

### ✅ 4. Database Migrations
- ✅ Reset existing database to clean state
- ✅ Created initial migration (`20250716161113_init`)
- ✅ Applied migration successfully to Neon database
- ✅ Verified all tables created with correct structure
- ✅ Generated Prisma client successfully

### ✅ 5. Database Utility Functions
Created comprehensive utility functions in `src/lib/database/`:

**Users (`users.ts`)**:
- ✅ `createUser()` - Create new user record
- ✅ `getUserByClerkId()` - Fetch user by Clerk ID
- ✅ `updateUserPreferences()` - Update user preferences
- ✅ `deleteUser()` - Delete user record
- ✅ `upsertUser()` - Create or update user

**Documents (`documents.ts`)**:
- ✅ `createDocument()` - Create new document record
- ✅ `getDocumentById()` - Fetch document with relations
- ✅ `getUserDocuments()` - Get user's documents with pagination
- ✅ `updateDocumentStatus()` - Update processing status
- ✅ `getDocumentsForDeletion()` - Find documents to delete based on retention
- ✅ `softDeleteDocument()` - Soft delete with timestamp

**Document Files (`document-files.ts`)**:
- ✅ `createDocumentFile()` - Store file metadata
- ✅ `getDocumentFiles()` - Get files for document
- ✅ `getDocumentFile()` - Get single file by key
- ✅ `deleteDocumentFile()` - Remove file record
- ✅ `getOrphanedFiles()` - Find orphaned files for cleanup

**Extractions (`extractions.ts`)**:
- ✅ `createExtraction()` - Store AI extraction results
- ✅ `getExtractionsByDocument()` - Get all extractions for document
- ✅ `getLatestExtraction()` - Get most recent extraction
- ✅ `updateExtractionData()` - Update extraction with manual corrections
- ✅ `getExtractionsForReview()` - Find extractions needing review
- ✅ `getExtractionStats()` - Calculate extraction statistics

**Error Handling (`errors.ts`)**:
- ✅ `logError()` - Log processing errors
- ✅ `getErrorsByDocument()` - Get errors for document
- ✅ `markErrorResolved()` - Mark error as resolved
- ✅ `getUnresolvedErrors()` - Get unresolved errors
- ✅ `getErrorStats()` - Calculate error statistics
- ✅ `cleanupOldResolvedErrors()` - Cleanup old resolved errors

### ✅ 6. Connection Management
- ✅ Created proper Prisma client singleton pattern
- ✅ Added connection pooling configuration
- ✅ Implemented database health check function
- ✅ Created health check API endpoint (`/api/health/db`)
- ✅ Added graceful error handling for connection issues

### ✅ 7. Testing & Validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive test API (`/api/test/database`)
- ✅ Tested all CRUD operations for every model
- ✅ Verified foreign key relationships work correctly
- ✅ Tested error handling for invalid data
- ✅ Verified database constraints are enforced
- ✅ Confirmed cascade deletes work properly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All database operations tested and working

## 🏗️ Database Schema Created

### Tables:
1. **users** - User profiles synced with Clerk
2. **documents** - Document processing records
3. **document_files** - File storage metadata
4. **extractions** - AI extraction results
5. **processing_errors** - Error tracking

### Key Features:
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- ✅ Soft delete pattern for documents
- ✅ JSON fields for flexible data storage
- ✅ Retention logic for data management
- ✅ Error tracking with retry mechanisms

## 🔧 API Endpoints Created

- ✅ `GET /api/health/db` - Database health check
- ✅ `POST /api/test/database` - Comprehensive database test

## 📊 Test Results

All database operations tested successfully:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All database operations completed successfully",
  "results": {
    "user": true,
    "document": true,
    "documentFile": true,
    "extraction": true,
    "error": true,
    "cleanup": "completed"
  }
}
```
