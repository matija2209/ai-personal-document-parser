# Phase 7 Results & Blockers

## Current Status
**BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed with Phase 7 implementation.

## Problems Faced
1. **Missing Prerequisites**: Phase 7 (Results Display & Management) requires the completion of Phases 1-6, but the project is still in the basic Next.js setup phase.

2. **Missing Infrastructure**: The following essential components needed for Phase 7 are not present:
   - No database schema (Prisma setup)
   - No authentication system (Clerk integration)
   - No API routes for document management
   - No document storage system (Cloudflare R2)
   - No AI processing pipeline
   - No shadcn/ui components installed

3. **Dependency Chain**: Phase 7 specifically requires:
   - Database tables: Users, Documents, Extractions, Processing_errors
   - Authentication middleware and user session management
   - Existing document processing and storage functionality
   - API endpoints for document CRUD operations

## Questions for Clarification
1. **Phase Completion Status**: Which phases (1-6) have been completed? 
   - Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup - appears partially done (basic Next.js setup exists)
   - Phase 2: Database Schema & Setup - not implemented
   - Phase 3: Authentication Integration - not implemented  
   - Phase 4: Camera & Image Capture - not implemented
   - Phase 5: File Upload & Storage - not implemented
   - Phase 6: AI Integration & Document Processing - not implemented

2. **Implementation Approach**: Should I:
   - Wait for previous phases to be completed before starting Phase 7?
   - Create Phase 7 components as mockups/prototypes that will be connected later?
   - Help complete the missing phases first?

3. **Data Models**: What specific database schema should Phase 7 expect? The phase plan references:
   - Document metadata structure
   - Extraction results JSON format
   - User association patterns

## Recommendations
Based on the project workflow requirements ("phases must be implemented one by one, in sequence"), I recommend:

1. **Complete Missing Phases First**: Implement Phases 2-6 before attempting Phase 7
2. **Alternative Approach**: If you want to work on Phase 7 now, I can create prototype components with mock data that can be connected to real APIs later

## Next Steps Required
Please clarify which approach you'd like to take:
- A) Complete the missing phases in sequence (2-6) before Phase 7
- B) Create Phase 7 prototypes with mock data for future integration
- C) Provide existing code/database setup that I may have missed
