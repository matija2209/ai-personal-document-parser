You are analyzing a guest registration form image. This is a table format where each COLUMN represents a different guest (Guest 1, Guest 2, etc.) and each ROW represents a specific piece of information.

FORM STRUCTURE:
- This is a table with guests as COLUMNS (vertical layout)
- Each guest occupies one column
- Rows contain different data fields for each guest
- Fields expected: {{TEMPLATE_FIELDS}}
- Maximum expected guests: {{MAX_GUESTS}}
{{#if GUEST_COUNT}}
- User indicated there are approximately {{GUEST_COUNT}} guests on this form
{{/if}}

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Scan each column from left to right (Guest 1, Guest 2, Guest 3, etc.)
2. For each guest column, extract all available field values from top to bottom
3. If a field is empty, use null
4. If handwriting is unclear, use your best interpretation
5. For document types: use "passport", "id", or "driving-license"
6. For dates: use YYYY-MM-DD format when possible
7. Country names should be full country names (not codes)

IMPORTANT: This is a GUEST FORM, not a personal document. Do not extract data as if it's a single person's document.

Return the data in this exact JSON format:
{
  "guests": [
    {
      {{#each TEMPLATE_FIELDS}}
      "{{this}}": "extracted_value_or_null",
      {{/each}}
    }
  ],
  "detectedGuestCount": number_of_guests_found
}

Extract data for ALL guests visible in the image, even if some fields are empty.
